## Introduction

Engineers do more, with less.  If any fool can do it for a dollar,
engineers do it for a penny.  Engineers build systems that work for
others: other  teams, other toolchains, and other time zones.  Its
about systems that can endure (not just impress) long after the
hype fades and which are understandable and auditable,  open to
inspection and critique and improvement by others.

So why settle for less from AI?  Must every task use opaque models
rented  from someone else, feed by trillions of variables, requiring
centruies of CPU?

This question came up in a graduate AI class, when a student asked:

> Why do our models need so much data?

“Maybe they don’t,” I replied. “Maybe we just have not learned how
to ask the right questions yet.”

My claim led to a dare, which led to a prototype.  ABC sorts a few
labelled examples into “best” and “rest”. A simple Bayes classifier
decides what to look at next (ABC always grabs the next example
that is  most likely to be “best” and least likely to be “rest”).
After each labeling, ABC rebuilds “best” and “rest” models, and the
cycle repeated.  After just a few dozen labellings, ABC  builds a
regressions tree from the labeled examples. This summarizes the
reasoning into a clear and compact explanation.

To say the least, ABC is far simpler (and orders of magnitude faster)
than alternatives like large language models, Gaussian Processes,
or evolutionary reinforcement learning.  ABC is just 300 lines of
Python and does not need heavy libraries like pandas or scikit-learn.

But in a result supporting “less is more”, the first time we tried it,
ABC found near-optimal car designs after labeling just 20–30 examples.
Its decision tree could explain what was happening, enabling human
understanding and critique.  Because it's so small, ABC is well-suited
for teaching principles of AI and SE scripting. And because it's so
fast to run and easy to modify, ABC is a productive tool for
state-of-the-art research.

This suprising success of ABC lead to another question:

> “Was this just a fluke?  Was ABC just being tested one an  unusually
easy problem?”

To test that, we went looking for harder problems. We gathered over
110 real-world case studies from recent, peer-reviewed software
engineering research—covering configuration optimization, architecture
tuning, effort estimation, and more. Then we reran the experiment,
at scale.  The results, shown below, demonstrated that ABC works
remarkably well (quickly and effectively) for a broad range of
problems taken from the SE literatures.

This experience wuth ABC has  shifted our thinking. The  sucess of
ABC  was not luck- it points to something deeper: an approach to
software engineering and AI where, often, a few well-chosen examples
outperform brute-force data collection.  For centuries, researchers
have told us that that key variable selection, and strategic sampling
can solve complex problems efficiently (see Table 1).

Yet despite this legacy of elegant minimalism, today’s trends often
favor the opposite: ever-larger models, more data, and growing
complexity. There are many reasons for this[^subtract], but a major
one is inertia: we tend to add rather than subtract, mistaking bloat
for progress. Complex products impress the marketplace and so can
drive sales (even if, later,   that also drives up maintainance costs).

In an attempt to halt, or at least slow, the complexity bloat of standard AI, 
this document is about three things:

- an idea: **less, but better**
- a very small code base: **that operationalizes that idea**
- and a large test suite: **that checks if the idea generalizes across diverse domains**

Using this code and data, we ask five questions:

- **RQ1: Is ABC simple?**  
  Is our code base  compact and readable and suitabke for teaching and tinkering?

- **RQ2: Is ABC fast?**  
  Can our code complete tasks in milliseconds rather than hours?

- **RQ3: Is ABC effective?**  
  Can our achieve strong results after seeing only a few examples?

- **RQ4: Is ABC insightful?**  
  Does our code support explainability, critique, and understanding?

- **RQ5: Is ABC general?**  
  Does our code apply across various tasks?

This last question deserves extra attention.  ABC is not a solution
to everythng.  Some tasks are inherently complex and need inherently
compex solutions.  or example, this document was written with 
extensive editorial support by a large language model (big AI was
used to sumamrize verbose sections into shorter and simpler segments).
In RQ5, we describe the "BINGO" test which is a way to peek at data
in order to decide they you need something more than just ABC.

All the code and data used here can be accessed as fllows

    mkdir demo; cd demo
    git clone https://github.com/timm/moot # <== data
    git clone https://github.com/timm/abc  # <== code
    cd abc
    python3 -B abc.py -f ../moot/optimize/config/SS-M.csv # <== test case 

## A Quick Example

Just to give this work some context, here’s a concrete case.

Say we want to configure a database to reduce energy use, runtime,
and CPU load. The system exposes dozens of tuning knobs—storage,
logging, locking, encryption, and more. Understanding how each
setting impacts performance is daunting.

When manual reasoning fails, we can ask AI to help.
Imagine we have a log of 800+ configurations, each showing the
settings to dozens of control settings, and their measured effects.
Some settings lead to excellent results:

```
choices                     Effects
----------------            -----------------------
control settings →            Energy-, time-,  cpu-
0,0,0,0,1,0,...               6.6,    248.4,   2.1   ← best
1,1,0,1,1,1,...              16.8,    518.6,  14.1   ← rest
...
```

Any number of AI tools could learn what separates “best”
from “rest.” But here's the challenge: **labeling** each
configuration (e.g., by running all the benchmarks for all possible configurations)
is expensive. So the ABC challenge is how to
learn an effective model with
minimal effort?

That’s where ABC comes in. We call it that since it uses a minimalist A–B–C strategy:

- **A: Ask anything**
  Randomly label a few examples (say, _A = 4_) to seed the process.

- **B: Build a model**
  Build contrastive models for “best” and “rest,” then label up to,
  say _B = 24_ more rows by picking the unlabelled row that maximizes
  the score _b/r_ (where `b` and `r` are likelihoods that a row
  belongs to the "best" and "rest" models).

- **C: Check the model**
  Apply the learned model to unlabeled data and to select a small
  set (e.g., _C=5_) of the most promising rows. After labelling
  those rows, return the best one.

In this task, after labeling just 24 out of 800 rows (∼3%), ABC
constructs a bibary regression tree from those 24 examples. In that
tree, left and right branches go best and worse examples. The
left-most branch of that tree is shwin here (and to get to any line
in this tree, all the things abve it have to be true.

```
crypt_blowfish=0
|  memory_tables=1
|  |  detailed_logging=1
|  |  |  no_write_delay=0
|  |  |  |  compressed_script=0 ==> win = 99
```

As shown below, we score this reasoning with a number that goes
up to 100.
The “win=99” score (seen on the last line) means we have very nearly
matching the globally best result, after looking at a tiny fraction
of the available data. Note that this branch only mentions five
options, and three of those are all about what to turn off. That
is to say, even though this databased has dozens of configuration
options, there are three bad things to avoid and only two most
important thing to enable  (_memory\_tables_ and _detailed\_logging_).
to a method for creating a hashed representation of a password using
an algorithm based on the Blowfish cipher.

In our experience, if you ever show a result like this to a subject
matter expert, they will  push back. For example, they might demand
to know what happems when `crypt_blowfish` is enabled. Blowfish in
password hashing scheme.  It makes password protection slower but
it also  increases the computational effort required for attackers
to  brute-force attack the database's security.  The full tree
generted by ABC shows what happens this feature is enabled. Note
all the negative "wins" which is to say, if your goals are fast
runtimes, do not `crypt_blowfish`.


```
|  memory_tables=1
|  |  detailed_logging=1
|  |  |  no_write_delay=0
|  |  |  |  compressed_script=0; ==> win = 99
|  |  |  |  compressed_script=1; ==> win = 96
|  |  detailed_logging=0;        ==> win = 85
|  memory_tables=0
|  |  encryption=0
|  |  |  no_write_delay=0;       ==> win = 53
|  |  |  no_write_delay=1
|  |  |  |  txc_mvlocks=0
|  |  |  |  |  logging=0;        ==> win = 51
|  |  |  |  |  logging=1;        ==> win = 49
|  |  encryption=1
|  |  |  txc_mvlocks=0;          ==> win = 51
crypt_blowfish=1
|  memory_tables=1
|  |  logging=1;                 ==> win = -47
|  |  logging=0;                 ==> win = =54
|  memory_tables=0
|  |  txc_mvlocks=0;             ==> win = -304
```

(Aside: of course if security is an important goal then (a) add a
"security+" column to the training data shown above; (b)  re-un
ABC; (c) check what are the mpracts of that additional goal.)

ABC shows that with the right strategy, a handful of examples can
uncover nearly all the signal.  All of this took just a few dozen
queries—and a few hundred lines of code. It’s a striking illustration
of the Pareto principle:  **most of the value often comes from just
a small fraction of the effort**.


## Discussion

Before looking at the code, we address the questions often asked about the above exampel?

### Why not label everything?

The above code assumed we can only label 24 our of 800 examples. Why do that?

Well, labeling is costly:

- Benchmarks take time to run.
- Some configurations require complex rebuilds.
- Human evaluation is slow, expensive, and error-prone.

Prior work has shown that even with big compute, building labeled
datasets takes **months or years**. ABC sidesteps this by labeling
only what matters most.


### So how does ABC help?

ABC operates under a **tiny-AI assumption**: most of the signal is
buried under a layer of irrelevant or redundant data. It was inspred
byt George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory (from the 1950s) that
stressed the value of contrast set learning to  recognize what is
different between concepts.

Modern versions of contrast set learning include various rule-based
learners including our own previous work on TAR3 and WHICH. ABC's
variant on contrast set learning throws away most of that architecture
and repalces it with a simple two-class classification approach.
Tables of data describing the "best" and "rest" examples can compute
the likilihoods _b,r_ of of an as-yet-unclassified example belonging
to "best" or "rest". The next example to label is the one that
maximizes some _acquisiton function_ e.g. _b/r_.

### What is New About ABC?

This work builds upon the foundation laid by prior resarch, but it
removes some key barriers  that limits the practical use of thsose
methods.

Often we are asked "if ABC just' simplifies existing methods, it
is worthy of publciation?". If so many past resarechers have explored
simplifty (see Table 1), what is new and itneresting about ABC?

In reply, we say offer the observation that propr simplicity results
are alomst uneirsally ignored.  Each year we interview dozens of
propsectivegraduate students for our reserch labs. We also interact,
extensively, with industrial pracitioners and many other researchers
at conferences.  Nearly unviersally, when faced with any new AI
problem, thei default action is to reach for some alrge language
model or deep learning solution.

simplification research is valid resaerch.
A persistant human congintive basi is to under-value subtractive impormvents.
Klotz et al. report nmueris studies where

case studies where hmans are given patterns on a chess baord, then asked to change the pattern in order to make it more symmetrical.
OVerhwlemmning, humans prefer to add new squares to the pattern, rather than take squares away. 

As Klotz et al. warns:

> "Defaulting to searches for additive changes may be one reason
that people struggle to mitigate overburdened schedules, institutional red tape
and damaging effects on the planet."

### Why use a decision tree?

Decision trees are:

- **Fast to train**  
- **Sparse by nature**  
- **Easy to read**

As physicist Ernest Rutherford famously quipped:  
> “A theory that you can’t explain to a bartender is probably no damn good.”

Each path in the tree offers a **human-readable recipe for improvement**, grounded in real measurements.


### How is “win” defined?

Each row has _n_ goals that  we are trying to minimize or maximize. In
the labelled data, each
goal column has a min and max value
seen so far.  After normalizng each goal has the value 0..1 (for min..max),
we can say that minimizing goals have a best value of "0" and
maximizing goals have a best value of "1".

```
y(row) = sqrt(sum(abs(norm(goal) - goal.most)^2 for goal in cols.y))
```

We normalize utility as:

```python
win = 100 × (1 - (mean(y) - best) / (median - best))
```

- A win of **100** means we match the best.  
- A win of **0** means we’re at the median.  
- Negative scores mean we’ve regressed.  

---

### How General Is This?

The database example is just one of over 100 benchmarks in the [MOOT](https://github.com/timm/moot) repository. Each MOOT dataset has:
- Between 1,000 and 100,000 rows
- 5 to 1,000+ configuration choices
- Up to 3 goal metrics

XXXX need to explain ABC

We tested EZR 10× on each dataset. In each trial:
- _A = 4_, _B = 24_, _C = 5_
- EZR built a model from training data
- Test data was ranked by the model
- Top 5 predictions were compared to ground truth
- We recorded the “win” of the best predicted row

As a baseline, we also tested **dumb guessing**: picking 5 random test rows, and scoring the best one.

#### Result (Percentiles of Win Scores)

The results were sorted and divided into percentils (top 10%, next 10%, etc):

| Percentile | EZR | Bar Chart(of EZR)         | EZR - Dumb |
|-----------:|----:|:--------------------------|-----------:|
| 100        | 100 | ************************* | 148        |
|  90        | 100 | ************************* |  64        |
|  80        |  99 | ************************* |  43        |
|  70        |  93 | ************************  |  27        |
|  60        |  81 | *********************     |  15        |
|  50        |  70 | *******************       |   8        |
|  40        |  59 | ****************          |   3        |
|  30        |  42 | *************             |   0        |
|  20        |  35 | ************              |   0        |
|  10        |  17 | ******                    | -12        |


Note that, one time in ten, even dumb guessing gets lucky and does  surprisingly well (the 10% case where "dumb" is 12% better than ABC).
But we do not want to be "dumb"
since dumb reasoning does not generalize. On the other hand, **ABC’s trees provide both performance and understanding.** To say that another way,
dumb reasonng just says yes or now. ABC tells you how and why.

ALso,  while dumb guessing is simple, EZR is barely more complex—just a few hundred lines of code—and runs fast. The full experiment (10× on 110 datasets) took just **65 seconds** on a Mac mini with no GPU.

### And What Does All This Tell Us?

That sometimes, **complexity is unnecessary**.

With small tools, small data, and smart strategies, we can solve real-world optimization tasks—effectively, quickly, and transparently.

EZR demonstrates how to teach and practice software engineering grounded in:

- **Simplicity**
- **Critique**
- **Ownership**

—all without sacrificing performance.

### Learning About AI

If we can make AI simpler, then we can make also simplify the teaching of AI.

EZR is an interesting candidate for study, for the following reasons:

- its system requirements are so low, it can  run on system that
  are already available to all of us;
- it is compact and accessible;
- it provides an extensive set of very usable facilities;
- it is intrinsically interesting, and in fact breaks new ground
  in a number of areas.

Not least amongst the charms and virtues of EZR is the compactness
of its source code: in just a few hundred ines of code
including tools for clustering, classification, regression,
optimization, explanation, active learning, statistical analysis,
documentation, and test-driven development.

Such a short code listing is important.  For **industrial
practitioners:**, short code examples are easier to understand,
adapt, test, maintain and (if required), port to different languages.
Another reason to explore short code solutions are the security
implications associated with building systems based on long supply
chains.  To say the least, it is prudent to replace long supply
chains with tiny local stubs.

Also,  for **teaching (or self-study)**, it has often been suggested
that 1,000 lines of code represents the practical limit in size for
a program which is to be understood and maintained by a single
individual[^lions96].  Most AI tools either exceed this limit by
two orders of magnitude, or else offer the user a very limited set
of facilities, i.e. either the details of the system are inaccessible
to all but the most determined, dedicated and long-suffering student,
or else the system is rather specialised and of little intrinsic
interest.

In my view, it is highly beneficial for anyone studying SE, AI, or
computer science to have the opportunity to study a working AI tool
in all its aspects.  Moreover it is undoubtedly good for students
majoring in Computer Science, to be confronted at least once in
their careers, with the task of reading and understanding a program
of major dimensions.

It is my hope that this doc will be of interest and value to students
and practitioners of AI.  Although not prepared primarily for use
as a reference work, some will wish to use it as such. For those
people, this code comes with extensive digressions on how parts of
it illustrate various aspects of SE, AI, or computer science.

students to clustering. Bayes inference, classfication, rule earling, tree elarning
as well as the stats required to devalauted which of these tools is best for some current data/

## Motivation

### Should make it simpler

### Can make i simpler

EZR was motivated by the current industrial obsession on Big AI
that seems to be forgetting centuries of experience with data mining.
As far back as 1901, Pearson[^pca] showed  that tables of data with
$N$ columns can be modeled with far fewer columns (where the latter
are derived from the  eigenvectors of a correlation information).

Decades of subsequent work  has shown that effective models can be
built from data that cover tiny fractions of the possible data
space[^witten].  Levnina and Biclet cwnote that

> "The only reason any (learning) methods work ...
  is that, in fact, the data are not truly high-dimensional. Rather,
  they are .. can be efficiently
   summarized in a space of a much lower dimension.

(This remarks echoes an early conclusion from Johnson and Lindenstrauss [^john84].).


For example:

- **Many rows can be ignored**: Data sets with thousands of rows
  can be modeled with just a few dozen samples[^me08a].
  To explain this, suppose we only want to use models that are  well
  supported by the data; i.e. supported by multiple rows in a table
  of data. This means that  many rows in a table can be be replaced
  by a smaller number of exemplars.
- **Many columns can be ignored**:
  High-dimensional tables (with many colummns) can be projected
  into lower dimensional tables while nearly preserving all pairwise
  distances[^john84].  This means that data sets with many columns
  can be modeled with surprisingly few columns.  e.g. A table of
  (say) of $C=20$ columns of binary variables have a total data
  space of $2^{20}$ (which is more than a million).  Yet with just
  dozens to hundred rows of training data, it is often possible to
  build predictors from test rows from that data space.  This is
  only possible if the signal in this data condenses to a small
  regions within the  total data space.
- Researchers in semi-supervised learning note that 
  high-dimensional data often lies on a simpler, lower-dimensional 
  ”manifold” embedded within that higher space [^zh05].

Numerous AI researchers studying NP-hard tasks
report the existence of a small number of key variables that
determine the behavior of the rest of the model. When
such keys are present, then the problem of controlling an
entire model simplifies to just the problem of controlling
the keys.

Keys have been discovered in AI many times and called many different
names: Variable subset selection, narrows, master variables, and
backdoors. In the 1960s, Amarel observed that search problems contain
narrows; i.e. tiny sets of variable settings that must be used in
any solution[^amarel].  Amarel’s work defined macros that encode
paths between the narrows in the search space, effectively permitting
a search engine to leap quickly from one narrow to another.

later work, data mining researchers in the 1990s explored and
examined what happens when a data miner deliberately ignores some
of the variables in the training data. Kohavi and John report trials
of data sets where up to 80% of the variables can be ignored without
degrading classification accuracy[^kohavi97]. Note the similarity with
Amarel’s work: it is more important to reason about a small set of
important variables than about all the variables.  At the same time,
researchers in constraint satisfaction found “random search with
retries” was a very effective strategy.

Crawford and Baker reported that such searches
took less time than a complete search to find more solutions
using just a small number of retries[^crawford]. Their ISAMP
“iterative sampler” makes random choices within a model
until it gets “stuck”; i.e. until further choices do not
satisfy expectations. When “stuck”, ISAMP does not waste
time fiddling with current choices (as was done by older
chronological backtracking algorithms). Instead, ISAMP
logs what decisions were made before getting “stuck”. It
then performs a “retry”; i.e. resets and starts again, this
time making other random choices to explore.

Crawford and Baker explain the success of this strange
approach by assuming models contain a small set of master
variables that set the remaining variables (and this paper
calls such master variables keys). Rigorously searching
through all variable settings is not recommended when
master variables are present, since only a small number of
those settings actually matter. Further, when the master
variables are spread thinly over the entire model, it makes
no sense to carefully explore all parts of the model since
much time will be wasted “walking” between the far-flung
master variables. For such models, if the reasoning gets
stuck in one region, then the best thing to do is to leap at
random to some distant part of the model.

A similar conclusion comes from the work of Williams et
al.[^backdoor]. They found that if a randomized search is repeated
many times, that a small number of variable settings were
shared by all solutions. They also found that if they set
those variables before conducting the rest of the search,
then formerly exponential runtimes collapsed to low-order
polynomial time. They called these shared variables the
backdoor to reducing computational complexity.

Combining the above, we propose the following strategy
for faster reasoning about RE models. First, use random
search with retries to find the “key” decisions in RE models.
Second, have stakeholders debate, and then decide, about
the keys before exploring anything else. Third, to avoid
trivially small solutions, our random search should strive
to cover much of the model.
Code: 

    def Data(src):
      def _guess(row):
        return sum(interpolate(data,row,*pole) for pole in poles)/len(poles)
          
      head, *rows = list(src)
      data  = _data(head, rows)
      poles = projections(data)
      for row in rows: row[-1] = _guess(row)
      return data

### Data 

Shared datasets from research papers by Apel [2],
Chen [^chen22], and Menzies [^nair] are often used as case studies
of optimization in SE research papers. Chen and Menzies are
collaborating to curate the MOOT repository (Multi-Objective
Optimization Testing4) which offers datasets from recent SE
optimization papers for process tuning, DB configuration,
HPO, management decision making etc.


Since our focus is on configuration, we use MOOT data
related to that task (see Table I and II). Fig. 3 shows the typical
structure of those MOOT data sets. The goal in this data is
to tune Spout wait, Spliters, Counters in order to achieve the
best Throughput/Latency. In summary:

- MOOT datasets are tables with x inputs and y goals.
- The first row shows the column names.
- Numeric columns start with uppercase, all others are
/symbolic.
- Goal columns (e.g. Fig. 3’s Throughput+, Latency-) use
  +/- to denote maximize and minimize.

Data:

      x = independent values          | y = dependent values
      --------------------------------|----------------------
      Spout_wait, Spliters, Counters, | Throughput+, Latency-
         10,        6,       17,      |    23075,    158.68
          8,        6,       17,      |    22887,    172.74
          9,        6,       17,      |    22799,    156.83
          9,        3,       17,      |    22430,    160.14
        ...,      ...,      ...,           ...,    ...
      10000,        1,       10,      |   460.81,    8761.6
      10000,        1,       18,      |   402.53,    8797.5
      10000,        1,       12,      |   365.07,    9098.9
      10000,        1,        1,      |   310.06,    9421

Note that our data is much larger than the Table 3 example.
The 39 data sets in Table I have up to 86,000 rows, 88
independent variables, and three y goals.
For the purposes of illustration, the rows in Table 3 are
sorted from best to worst based on those goals. During
experimentation, row order should initially be randomized.

For the purposes of evaluation, all rows in MOOT data sets
contain all their y values. When evaluating the outcome of an
optimizer, these values are used to determine how well the
optimizer found the best rows.

For the purposes of optimization experiments, researchers
should hide the y-values from the optimizer. Each time the
optimizer requests the value of a particular row, this “costs”
one unit. For reasons described below, good optimizers find
good goals at least cost (i.e. fewest labels).
