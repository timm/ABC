<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Engineers do more, with less. If any fool can do it for a dollar,
engineers do it for a penny. Engineers build systems that work for
others: other teams, other toolchains, and other time zones. Its about
systems that can endure (not just impress) long after the hype fades and
which are understandable and auditable, open to inspection and critique
and improvement by others.</p>
<p>So why settle for less from AI? Must every task use opaque models
rented from someone else, feed by trillions of variables, requiring
centruies of CPU?</p>
<p>This question came up in a graduate AI class, when a student
asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do our models need so much data?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Maybe they don’t,” I replied. “Maybe we just have not learned how to
ask the right questions yet.”</p>
<p>My claim led to a dare, which led to a prototype. ABC sorts a few
labelled examples into “best” and “rest”. A simple Bayes classifier
decides what to look at next (ABC always grabs the next example that is
most likely to be “best” and least likely to be “rest”). After each
labeling, ABC rebuilds “best” and “rest” models, and the cycle repeated.
After just a few dozen labellings, ABC builds a regressions tree from
the labeled examples. This summarizes the reasoning into a clear and
compact explanation.</p>
<p>To say the least, ABC is far simpler (and orders of magnitude faster)
than alternatives like large language models, Gaussian Processes, or
evolutionary reinforcement learning. ABC is just 300 lines of Python and
does not need heavy libraries like pandas or scikit-learn.</p>
<p>But in a result supporting “less is more”, the first time we tried
it, ABC found near-optimal car designs after labeling just 20–30
examples. Its decision tree could explain what was happening, enabling
human understanding and critique. Because it’s so small, ABC is
well-suited for teaching principles of AI and SE scripting. And because
it’s so fast to run and easy to modify, ABC is a productive tool for
state-of-the-art research.</p>
<p>This suprising success of ABC lead to another question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Was this just a fluke? Was ABC just being tested one an unusually
easy problem?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To test that, we went looking for harder problems. We gathered over
110 real-world case studies from recent, peer-reviewed software
engineering research—covering configuration optimization, architecture
tuning, effort estimation, and more. Then we reran the experiment at
scale. The results, shown below, demonstrated that ABC works remarkably
well (quickly and effectively) for a broad range of problems taken from
the SE literatures.</p>
<p>This experience wuth ABC has shifted our thinking. The sucess of ABC
was not luck- it points to something deeper: an approach to software
engineering and AI where, often, a few well-chosen examples outperform
brute-force data collection. For centuries, researchers have told us
that that key variable selection, and strategic sampling can solve
complex problems efficiently (see Table 1).</p>
<p>Yet despite this legacy of elegant minimalism, today’s trends often
favor the opposite: ever-larger models, more data, and growing
complexity. There are many reasons for this[^subtract], but a major one
is inertia—we tend to add rather than subtract, mistaking bloat for
progress. Complex products impress the marketplace and so can drive
sales (even if, later, that drives up maintainance costs).</p>

<p>In an attempt to halt, or at least slow, the complexity bloat of
standard AI, this document is about three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>an idea: <strong>less, but better</strong></li>
<li>a very small code base: <strong>that operationalizes that
idea</strong></li>
<li>and a large test suite: <strong>that checks if the idea generalizes
across diverse domains</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Using this code and data, we ask five questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RQ1: Is ABC simple?</strong><br />
Is our code base compact and readable and suitabke for teaching and
tinkering?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ2: Is ABC fast?</strong><br />
Can our code complete tasks in milliseconds rather than hours?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ3: Is ABC effective?</strong><br />
Can our achieve strong results after seeing only a few
examples?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ4: Is ABC insightful?</strong><br />
Does our code support explainability, critique, and
understanding?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ5: Is ABC general?</strong><br />
Does our code apply across various tasks?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This last question deserves extra attention. ABC is not a solution to
everythng. Some tasks are inherently complex and need inherently compex
solutions. or example, this document was written with extensive
editorial support by a large language model (big AI was used to
sumamrize verbose sections into shorter and simpler segments). In RQ5,
we describe the “BINGO” test which is a way to peek at data in order to
decide they you need something more than just ABC.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-example">A Quick Example</h2>
<p>Just to give this work some context, here’s a concrete case.</p>
<p>Say we want to configure a database to reduce energy use, runtime,
and CPU load. The system exposes dozens of tuning knobs—storage,
logging, locking, encryption, and more. Understanding how each setting
impacts performance is daunting.</p>
<p>When manual reasoning fails, we can ask AI to help. Imagine we have a
log of 800+ configurations, each showing the settings to dozens of
control settings, and their measured effects. Some settings lead to
excellent results:</p>
<pre><code>choices                     Effects
----------------            -----------------------
control settings →            Energy-, time-,  cpu-
0,0,0,0,1,0,...               6.6,    248.4,   2.1   ← best
1,1,0,1,1,1,...              16.8,    518.6,  14.1   ← rest
...</code></pre>
<p>Any number of AI tools could learn what separates “best” from “rest.”
But here’s the challenge: <strong>labeling</strong> each configuration
(e.g., by running all the benchmarks for all possible configurations) is
expensive. So the ABC challenge is how to learn an effective model with
minimal effort?</p>
<p>That’s where ABC comes in. We call it that since it uses a minimalist
A–B–C strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A: Ask anything</strong> Randomly label a few examples
(say, <em>A = 4</em>) to seed the process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>B: Build a model</strong> Build contrastive models for
“best” and “rest,” then label up to, say <em>B = 24</em> more rows by
picking the unlabelled row that maximizes the score <em>b/r</em> (where
<code>b</code> and <code>r</code> are likelihoods that a row belongs to
the “best” and “rest” models).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>C: Check the model</strong> Apply the learned model to
unlabeled data and to select a small set (e.g., <em>C=5</em>) of the
most promising rows. After labelling those rows, return the best
one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this task, after labeling just 24 out of 800 rows (∼3%), ABC
constructs a bibary regression tree from those 24 examples. In that
tree, left and right branches go best and worse examples. The left-most
branch of that tree is shwin here (and to get to any line in this tree,
all the things abve it have to be true.</p>
<pre><code>crypt_blowfish=0
|  memory_tables=1
|  |  detailed_logging=1
|  |  |  no_write_delay=0
|  |  |  |  compressed_script=0 ==&gt; win = 99</code></pre>
<p>As shown below, we score this reasoning with a number that goes up to
100. The “win=99” score (seen on the last line) means we have very
nearly matching the globally best result, after looking at a tiny
fraction of the available data. Note that this branch only mentions five
options, and three of those are all about what to turn off. That is to
say, even though this databased has dozens of configuration options,
there are three bad things to avoid and only two most important thing to
enable (<em>memory_tables</em> and <em>detailed_logging</em>). to a
method for creating a hashed representation of a password using an
algorithm based on the Blowfish cipher.</p>
<p>In our experience, if you ever show a result like this to a subject
matter expert, they will push back. For example, they might demand to
know what happems when <code>crypt_blowfish</code> is enabled. Blowfish
in password hashing scheme. It makes password protection slower but it
also increases the computational effort required for attackers to
brute-force attack the database’s security. The full tree generted by
ABC shows what happens this feature is enabled. Note all the negative
“wins” which is to say, if your goals are fast runtimes, do not
<code>crypt_blowfish</code>.</p>
<pre><code>|  memory_tables=1
|  |  detailed_logging=1
|  |  |  no_write_delay=0
|  |  |  |  compressed_script=0; ==&gt; win = 99

“security+” column to the training data shown above; (b) re-un ABC; (c)
check what are the mpracts of that additional goal.)</p>
<p>ABC shows that with the right strategy, a handful of examples can
uncover nearly all the signal. All of this took just a few dozen
queries—and a few hundred lines of code. It’s a striking illustration of
the Pareto principle: <strong>most of the value often comes from just a
small fraction of the effort</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Before looking at the code, we address the questions often asked
about the above exampel?</p>
<h3 id="why-not-label-everything">Why not label everything?</h3>
<p>The above code assumed we can only label 24 our of 800 examples. Why
do that?</p>
<p>Well, labeling is costly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmarks take time to run.</li>
<li>Some configurations require complex rebuilds.</li>
<li>Human evaluation is slow, expensive, and error-prone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior work has shown that even with big compute, building labeled
datasets takes <strong>months or years</strong>. ABC sidesteps this by
labeling only what matters most.</p>
<h3 id="so-how-does-abc-help">So how does ABC help?</h3>
<p>ABC operates under a <strong>tiny-AI assumption</strong>: most of the
signal is buried under a layer of irrelevant or redundant data. It was
inspred byt George Kelly’s Personal Construct Theory (from the 1950s)
that stressed the value of contrast set learning to recognize what is
different between concepts.</p>
<p>Modern versions of contrast set learning include various rule-based
learners including our own previous work on TAR3 and WHICH. ABC’s
variant on contrast set learning throws away most of that architecture
and repalces it with a simple two-class classification approach. Tables
of data describing the “best” and “rest” examples can compute the
likilihoods <em>b,r</em> of of an as-yet-unclassified example belonging
to “best” or “rest”. The next example to label is the one that maximizes
some <em>acquisiton function</em> e.g. <em>b/r</em>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-new-about-abc">What is New About ABC?</h3>
<p>This work builds upon the foundation laid by prior resarch, but it
removes some key barriers that limits the practical use of thsose
methods.</p>
<p>Often we are asked “if ABC just’ simplifies existing methods, it is
worthy of publciation?”. If so many past resarechers have explored
simplifty (see Table 1), what is new and itneresting about ABC?</p>
<p>In reply, we say offer the observation that propr simplicity results
are alomst uneirsally ignored. Each year we interview dozens of
propsectivegraduate students for our reserch labs. We also interact,
extensively, with industrial pracitioners and many other researchers at
conferences. Nearly unviersally, when faced with any new AI problem,
thei default action is to reach for some alrge language model or deep
learning solution.</p>
<p>simplification research is valid resaerch. A persistant human
congintive basi is to under-value subtractive impormvents. Klotz et
al. report nmueris studies where</p>
<p>case studies where hmans are given patterns on a chess baord, then
asked to change the pattern in order to make it more symmetrical.
OVerhwlemmning, humans prefer to add new squares to the pattern, rather
than take squares away.</p>
<p>As Klotz et al. warns:</p>

<p>“Defaulting to searches for additive changes may be one reason that
people struggle to mitigate overburdened schedules, institutional red
tape and damaging effects on the planet.”</p>

<p>Decision trees are:</p>

<li><strong>Fast to train</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Sparse by nature</strong><br />

<li><strong>Easy to read</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As physicist Ernest Rutherford famously quipped:<br />
&gt; “A theory that you can’t explain to a bartender is probably no damn
good.”</p>
<p>Each path in the tree offers a <strong>human-readable recipe for
improvement</strong>, grounded in real measurements.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-win-defined">How is “win” defined?</h3>
<p>Each row has <em>n</em> goals that we are trying to minimize or
maximize. In the labelled data, each goal column has a min and max value
seen so far. After normalizng each goal has the value 0..1 (for
min..max), we can say that minimizing goals have a best value of “0” and
maximizing goals have a best value of “1”.</p>
<pre><code>y(row) = sqrt(sum(abs(norm(goal) - goal.most)^2 for goal in cols.y))</code></pre>
<p>We normalize utility as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A win of <strong>100</strong> means we match the best.<br />

<li>A win of <strong>0</strong> means we’re at the median.<br />

<p>Note that, one time in ten, even dumb guessing gets lucky and does
surprisingly well (the 10% case where “dumb” is 12% better than ABC).
But we do not want to be “dumb” since dumb reasoning does not
generalize. On the other hand, <strong>ABC’s trees provide both
performance and understanding.</strong> To say that another way, dumb
reasonng just says yes or now. ABC tells you how and why.</p>
<p>ALso, while dumb guessing is simple, EZR is barely more complex—just
a few hundred lines of code—and runs fast. The full experiment (10× on
110 datasets) took just <strong>65 seconds</strong> on a Mac mini with
no GPU.</p>
<h3 id="and-what-does-all-this-tell-us">And What Does All This Tell
Us?</h3>
<p>That sometimes, <strong>complexity is unnecessary</strong>.</p>
<p>With small tools, small data, and smart strategies, we can solve
real-world optimization tasks—effectively, quickly, and
transparently.</p>
<p>EZR demonstrates how to teach and practice software engineering
grounded in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Critique</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>—all without sacrificing performance.</p>

<p>If we can make AI simpler, then we can make also simplify the
teaching of AI.</p>
<p>EZR is an interesting candidate for study, for the following
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>its system requirements are so low, it can run on system that are
already available to all of us;</li>
<li>it is compact and accessible;</li>
<li>it provides an extensive set of very usable facilities;</li>
<li>it is intrinsically interesting, and in fact breaks new ground in a
number of areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not least amongst the charms and virtues of EZR is the compactness of
its source code: in just a few hundred ines of code including tools for
clustering, classification, regression, optimization, explanation,
active learning, statistical analysis, documentation, and test-driven
development.</p>
<p>Such a short code listing is important. For <strong>industrial
practitioners:</strong>, short code examples are easier to understand,
adapt, test, maintain and (if required), port to different languages.
Another reason to explore short code solutions are the security
implications associated with building systems based on long supply
chains. To say the least, it is prudent to replace long supply chains
with tiny local stubs.</p>
<p>Also, for <strong>teaching (or self-study)</strong>, it has often
been suggested that 1,000 lines of code represents the practical limit
in size for a program which is to be understood and maintained by a
single individual<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Most AI tools either exceed this
limit by two orders of magnitude, or else offer the user a very limited
set of facilities, i.e. either the details of the system are
inaccessible to all but the most determined, dedicated and
long-suffering student, or else the system is rather specialised and of
little intrinsic interest.</p>
<p>In my view, it is highly beneficial for anyone studying SE, AI, or
computer science to have the opportunity to study a working AI tool in
all its aspects. Moreover it is undoubtedly good for students majoring
in Computer Science, to be confronted at least once in their careers,
with the task of reading and understanding a program of major
dimensions.</p>
<p>It is my hope that this doc will be of interest and value to students
and practitioners of AI. Although not prepared primarily for use as a
reference work, some will wish to use it as such. For those people, this
code comes with extensive digressions on how parts of it illustrate
various aspects of SE, AI, or computer science.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<h3 id="should-make-it-simpler">Should make it simpler</h3>
<h3 id="can-make-i-simpler">Can make i simpler</h3>
<p>EZR was motivated by the current industrial obsession on Big AI that
seems to be forgetting centuries of experience with data mining. As far
back as 1901, Pearson<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> showed that tables of data with
<span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> columns can be modeled with
far fewer columns (where the latter are derived from the eigenvectors of
a correlation information).</p>
<p>Decades of subsequent work has shown that effective models can be
built from data that cover tiny fractions of the possible data space<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. Levnina and Biclet cwnote that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only reason any (learning) methods work … is that, in fact, the
data are not truly high-dimensional. Rather, they are .. can be
efficiently summarized in a space of a much lower dimension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This remarks echoes an early conclusion from Johnson and
Lindenstrauss <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>.).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many rows can be ignored</strong>: Data sets with thousands
of rows can be modeled with just a few dozen samples<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.
To explain this, suppose we only want to use models that are well
supported by the data; i.e. supported by multiple rows in a table of
data. This means that many rows in a table can be be replaced by a
smaller number of exemplars.</li>
<li><strong>Many columns can be ignored</strong>: High-dimensional
tables (with many colummns) can be projected into lower dimensional
tables while nearly preserving all pairwise distances<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.
This means that data sets with many columns can be modeled with
surprisingly few columns. e.g. A table of (say) of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em> = 20</span> columns of binary variables
have a total data space of <span
class="math inline">2<sup>20</sup></span> (which is more than a
million). Yet with just dozens to hundred rows of training data, it is
often possible to build predictors from test rows from that data space.
This is only possible if the signal in this data condenses to a small
regions within the total data space.</li>
<li>Researchers in semi-supervised learning note that high-dimensional
data often lies on a simpler, lower-dimensional ”manifold” embedded
within that higher space <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Numerous AI researchers studying NP-hard tasks report the existence
of a small number of key variables that determine the behavior of the
rest of the model. When such keys are present, then the problem of
controlling an entire model simplifies to just the problem of
controlling the keys.</p>
<p>Keys have been discovered in AI many times and called many different
names: Variable subset selection, narrows, master variables, and
backdoors. In the 1960s, Amarel observed that search problems contain
narrows; i.e. tiny sets of variable settings that must be used in any
solution<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. Amarel’s work defined macros that
encode paths between the narrows in the search space, effectively
permitting a search engine to leap quickly from one narrow to
another.</p>
<p>In later work, data mining researchers in the 1990s explored and
examined what happens when a data miner deliberately ignores some of the
variables in the training data. Kohavi and John report trials of data
sets where up to 80% of the variables can be ignored without degrading
classification accuracy<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. Note the similarity with Amarel’s
work: it is more important to reason about a small set of important
variables than about all the variables. At the same time, researchers in
constraint satisfaction found “random search with retries” was a very
effective strategy.</p>
<p>Crawford and Baker reported that such searches took less time than a
complete search to find more solutions using just a small number of
retries<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>. Their ISAMP “iterative sampler”
makes random choices within a model until it gets “stuck”; i.e. until
further choices do not satisfy expectations. When “stuck”, ISAMP does
not waste time fiddling with current choices (as was done by older
chronological backtracking algorithms). Instead, ISAMP logs what
decisions were made before getting “stuck”. It then performs a “retry”;
i.e. resets and starts again, this time making other random choices to
explore.</p>
<p>Crawford and Baker explain the success of this strange approach by
assuming models contain a small set of master variables that set the
remaining variables (and this paper calls such master variables keys).
Rigorously searching through all variable settings is not recommended
when master variables are present, since only a small number of those
settings actually matter. Further, when the master variables are spread
thinly over the entire model, it makes no sense to carefully explore all
parts of the model since much time will be wasted “walking” between the
far-flung master variables. For such models, if the reasoning gets stuck
in one region, then the best thing to do is to leap at random to some
distant part of the model.</p>
<p>A similar conclusion comes from the work of Williams et al.<a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>. They found that if a randomized
search is repeated many times, that a small number of variable settings
were shared by all solutions. They also found that if they set those
variables before conducting the rest of the search, then formerly
exponential runtimes collapsed to low-order polynomial time. They called
these shared variables the backdoor to reducing computational
complexity.</p>
<p>Combining the above, we propose the following strategy for faster
reasoning about RE models. First, use random search with retries to find
the “key” decisions in RE models. Second, have stakeholders debate, and
then decide, about the keys before exploring anything else. Third, to
avoid trivially small solutions, our random search should strive to
cover much of the model. Code:</p>

making etc.</p>

task (see Table I and II). Fig. 3 shows the typical structure of those

<p>Note that our data is much larger than the Table 3 example. The 39
data sets in Table I have up to 86,000 rows, 88 independent variables,
and three y goals. For the purposes of illustration, the rows in Table 3
are sorted from best to worst based on those goals. During
experimentation, row order should initially be randomized.</p>
<p>For the purposes of evaluation, all rows in MOOT data sets contain
all their y values. When evaluating the outcome of an optimizer, these
values are used to determine how well the optimizer found the best
rows.</p>
<p>For the purposes of optimization experiments, researchers should hide
the y-values from the optimizer. Each time the optimizer requests the
value of a particular row, this “costs” one unit. For reasons described
below, good optimizers find good goals at least cost (i.e. fewest
labels).</p>
