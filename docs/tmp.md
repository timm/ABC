It is prudent to ask if this is a real result. Perhaps it is a mere  fluke of using simplistic or unrealistic test data?

## Background
In sumamry, Bayes theorem says that new beliefs can be redived from old beliefs times any new evidence:

$$new = now * old $$

Given $N$ examples and old hypothesis that occur at frequencues $n_1,n_2..$ etc, then the prior old beliefs
have probability  

$$old = P(H_i)=\frac{n_i}{N}$$.  

In that old data, we can observe that attribute ranges $r_1,r_2...r_j$ have different frequencies $f(r_j)$ in different
hypotheses $H_i$; i.e. P(f(r_j)|H_i) = \frac{f(r_j)}{n_i}$. Given an example with multiple attribute ranges, can compute the likelihood it helongs to
some hypothesis as the product

$$now = \sum  P(f_j|H_i)$$

_j


If a new example comples along, we can compute the likelihood that it belongs to $H_i$attribute ranged have difference 

is more "best" than "rest".

sorts a few
labelled examples into “best” and “rest”. A simple Bayes classifier
decides what to look at next (EZR always grabs the next example
that is  most likely to be “best” and least likely to be “rest”).
After each labeling, EZR rebuilds “best” and “rest” models, and the
cycle repeated.  After just a few dozen labellings, EZR  builds a
regressions tree from the labeled examples. This summarizes the
reasoning into a clear and compact explanation.

To say the least, EZR is far simpler (and orders of magnitude faster)
than alternatives like large language models, Gaussian Processes,
or evolutionary reinforcement learning.  EZR is just 300 lines of
Python and does not need heavy libraries like pandas or scikit-learn.

But in a result supporting “less is more”, the first time we tried it,
EZR found near-optimal car designs after labeling just 20–30 examples.
Its decision tree could explain what was happening, enabling human
understanding and critique.  Because it's so small, EZR is well-suited
for teaching principles of AI and SE scripting. And because it's so
fast to run and easy to modify, EZR is a productive tool for
state-of-the-art research.

This suprising success of EZR lead to another question:

> “Was this just a fluke?  Was EZR just being tested one an  unusually
easy problem?”

To test that, we went looking for harder problems. We gathered over
110 real-world case studies from recent, peer-reviewed software
engineering research—covering configuration optimization, architecture
tuning, effort estimation, and more. Then we reran the experiment,
at scale.  The results, shown below, demonstrated that EZR works
remarkably well (quickly and effectively) for a broad range of
problems taken from the SE literatures.
